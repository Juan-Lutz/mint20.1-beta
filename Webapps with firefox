When I create a Webapps using firefox to read the Whatsapp it create it OK, the first go is OK but if I close it and click on the created webapp later,
it open firefox showing a black window not the whatsapp page. It does not happen if I use Chrome instead of firefox. This behaviour appears also in LM 20 !
